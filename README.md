# Detecting_Abnormalities_in_Chest_X_rays
## Objective
The objective for this project is to create neural network machine learning models using AlexNet, Inception, and ResNet architectures. The hope is to have at least one of these three models produce high accuracy metrics, if not all. In addition, exploring the different architectures will help reveal the best structure for this type of dataset. Creating these models is extremely beneficial in the healthcare industry because they will be able to detect pneumonia or pulmonary disease efficiently to flag at-risk patients. 

Pneumonia is diagnosed in about four million adults per year in the United States and about 15% are hospitalized due to it and for the people whom are hospitalized, the aggregate cost comes to about four billion dollars a year (Fine et al., 2019). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pneumonia has a mortality rate of 15.1 per 100,000 of patients with pneumonia and about 15.3 per 100,000 for pulmonary disease (CDC, 2019).

Given the brief details of each disease, having a model to help detect pulmonary or pneumonia would benefit victims of these diseases greatly.
